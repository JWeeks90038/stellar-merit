                <h2>5. DAMAGED OR DEFECTIVE ITEMS</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Nature of Cement Statuary Products</h3>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Our products are handcrafted cement statuary items that are inherently fragile and susceptible to breakage during shipping despite professional packaging. By placing an order, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cement statues are heavy, brittle, and prone to chipping, cracking, or breaking</li>
                    <li>Minor surface imperfections, hairline cracks, or small chips may occur during manufacturing or shipping and are characteristic of handcrafted cement products</li>
                    <li>Variations in color, texture, and finish are normal for cement products</li>
                    <li>You accept responsibility for proper handling upon receipt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.2 Reporting Damage</h3>
                <p><strong>CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE INSPECTION REQUIRED:</strong> Due to the fragile nature of cement statuary, you must inspect all items immediately upon delivery while the carrier is still present. Damage or defects must be reported within seventy-two (72) hours of delivery. Claims submitted after this period will not be accepted under any circumstances.</p>

                <h3>5.3 Shipping Damage Protocol</h3>
                <p><strong>MANDATORY STEPS</strong> for items damaged during shipping:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>INSPECT BEFORE SIGNING:</strong> Examine the package for visible damage before accepting delivery</li>
                    <li><strong>NOTE DAMAGE ON DELIVERY RECEIPT:</strong> If outer packaging shows damage, note "PACKAGE DAMAGED" on the carrier's delivery receipt before signing</li>
                    <li><strong>REFUSE SEVERELY DAMAGED SHIPMENTS:</strong> If packaging is crushed or severely damaged, you have the right to refuse delivery</li>
                    <li><strong>DO NOT DISCARD ANYTHING:</strong> Keep all packaging materials, padding, boxes, and shipping labels</li>
                    <li><strong>PHOTOGRAPH EVERYTHING:</strong> Take multiple photographs showing:
                        <ul>
                            <li>All sides of the shipping box (before opening)</li>
                            <li>Shipping label with tracking number visible</li>
                            <li>All packaging materials and how the item was packed</li>
                            <li>All damage to the statue from multiple angles</li>
                            <li>Close-up photos of cracks, chips, or breaks</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY:</strong> Email photographs and your order number to [INSERT EMAIL] within 72 hours</li>
                    <li><strong>PRESERVE EVIDENCE:</strong> Keep all materials until we provide further instructions and obtain carrier approval</li>
