                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heavy Weight:</strong> Statues can weigh from 10 to over 200 pounds and require proper lifting techniques and multiple people for safe handling</li>
                    <li><strong>Fragile Material:</strong> Cement is brittle and can crack, chip, or shatter if dropped, impacted, or improperly handled</li>
                    <li><strong>Installation Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for proper installation, placement, and securing of products</li>

                    <li><strong>Weather Exposure:</strong> While cement can withstand weather, freeze-thaw cycles can cause cracking over time; proper drainage and seasonal protection are recommended</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling Precautions:</strong> Always use appropriate lifting equipment or assistance when moving heavy statues</li>
                    <li><strong>No Climbing:</strong> Statues are not designed to support additional weight and should never be climbed on</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>ASSUMPTION OF RISK:</strong> You expressly assume all risks associated with handling, installation, placement, and use of cement statuary products. We are not liable for:</p>
