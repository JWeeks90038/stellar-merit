                <h2>8. INSPECTION UPON DELIVERY - FRAGILE CEMENT STATUARY</h2>
                <h3>8.1 CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE INSPECTION MANDATORY</h3>
                <p><strong>CEMENT STATUES ARE EXTREMELY FRAGILE:</strong> Due to the brittle and heavy nature of cement statuary, you MUST inspect all packages immediately upon delivery while the carrier is still present. This is your ONLY opportunity to document shipping damage and file a valid claim.</p>

                <p><strong>DO NOT SIGN FOR DELIVERY UNTIL YOU HAVE INSPECTED THE PACKAGE.</strong></p>

                <p>Check for the following BEFORE accepting delivery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visible external damage:</strong> Crushed corners, punctures, tears, or dents in packaging</li>
                    <li><strong>Signs of impact:</strong> Boxes that appear to have been dropped or roughly handled</li>
                    <li><strong>Abnormal sounds:</strong> Rattling or shifting sounds indicating broken pieces inside</li>
                    <li><strong>Box integrity:</strong> Weak or sagging boxes from moisture or crushing</li>
                    <li><strong>Proper labeling:</strong> "FRAGILE" and "HEAVY" labels should be visible and intact</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8.2 Inspection Procedure for Cement Statuary</h3>
                <p><strong>STEP-BY-STEP MANDATORY PROCESS:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>BEFORE SIGNING:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examine all sides of the shipping box for damage</li>
                            <li>Look for crushing, punctures, water damage, or tears</li>
                            <li>Check if the box feels abnormally light or unstable</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>IF PACKAGE SHOWS DAMAGE:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>REFUSE DELIVERY if damage is severe (crushed box, large tears, visible breakage)</li>
                            <li>If accepting damaged package, write "DAMAGED - OPENED IN PRESENCE OF DRIVER" on delivery receipt</li>
                            <li>Ask carrier to wait while you open and inspect (this is your right)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>DOCUMENT EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY:</strong>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CAREFUL UNPACKING:</strong>

                            <li>Document how the statue was packed (foam, bubble wrap, cardboard inserts)</li>
                            <li>Look for loose pieces or cement dust (indicates breakage)</li>
                            <li>Carefully remove statue and inspect all surfaces</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>THOROUGH INSPECTION OF STATUE:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check for cracks, chips, or breaks on all surfaces</li>
                            <li>Examine base, top, and all sides</li>
                            <li>Look for structural integrity (does statue wobble or lean?)</li>
                            <li>Check for missing pieces or separated components</li>
                            <li>Photograph any damage from multiple angles</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>PRESERVE ALL EVIDENCE:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>DO NOT discard box, packaging materials, or broken pieces</li>
                            <li>DO NOT attempt repairs</li>
                            <li>DO NOT install or place statue outdoors</li>
                            <li>Keep everything exactly as received until claim is resolved</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>8.3 Damaged Shipments - Reporting Requirements</h3>
                <p><strong>TIME-SENSITIVE:</strong> Damage claims for fragile cement statuary must be reported within 72 hours of delivery. After this period, claims will be automatically denied.</p>

                <p><strong>Required Documentation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Order number</li>
                    <li>Tracking number</li>
                    <li>Photos of shipping box exterior (all sides, showing damage)</li>
                    <li>Photo of shipping label</li>
                    <li>Photos showing packaging materials and how item was packed</li>

                <p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Email all documentation to [INSERT EMAIL] with subject line "DAMAGE CLAIM - Order #[YOUR ORDER NUMBER]"</p>

                <h3>8.4 Concealed Damage</h3>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Given the fragile nature of cement statuary, concealed damage (damage not visible from the exterior of the shipping box) is common. However, this does NOT extend the inspection deadline.</p>

                <p>Concealed damage discovered after the carrier has left must still be reported within 72 hours of delivery. Claims submitted after this period will not be accepted. You must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retain ALL original packaging materials, boxes, and broken pieces</li>
                    <li>Provide comprehensive photographs as outlined in Section 8.2</li>
                    <li>Not use, install, or place the damaged statue outdoors</li>
                    <li>Not attempt any repairs or modifications</li>
                    <li>Not move the statue unnecessarily (keep in a safe location)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Installing, using, or placing a damaged statue outdoors before claim approval will void all damage claims and warranty coverage.</p>

                <h3>8.5 Packaging Standards for Fragile Items</h3>
                <p>We take extensive precautions to protect fragile cement statuary during shipping:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heavy-duty double-walled corrugated boxes</li>
                    <li>Multiple layers of bubble wrap and foam padding</li>
                    <li>Custom foam inserts for irregular shapes</li>
                    <li>Reinforced corners and edges</li>
                    <li>Clear "FRAGILE" and "HEAVY" markings on all sides</li>
                    <li>Handling instructions for carriers</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Despite these measures, the inherent brittleness of cement means breakage can still occur from impact, vibration, or improper handling during transit.</p>

                <h2>9. LOST OR STOLEN PACKAGES</h2>
                <h3>9.1 Lost Packages</h3>
                <p>If tracking shows your package as delivered but you did not receive it:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check with neighbors or household members</li>
                    <li>Look around your property (porches, garages, side doors)</li>
                    <li>Contact the carrier directly</li>
                    <li>Wait 48 hours for carrier investigation</li>
                    <li>Contact us if package remains unlocated after 48 hours</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>9.2 Stolen Packages</h3>
                <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Once a carrier confirms delivery, we are not responsible for stolen packages. We recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requiring signature for delivery</li>
                    <li>Using a secure delivery location</li>
                    <li>Installing security cameras</li>
                    <li>Filing a police report for stolen items</li>
                    <li>Contacting your homeowner's or renter's insurance</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9.3 Claims Process</h3>
                <p>We will cooperate with carrier investigations for lost or stolen packages, but we cannot guarantee replacement or refund for packages confirmed delivered by the carrier.</p>
